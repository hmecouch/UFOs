# UFOs

## Overview

The project involves implementing a filter feature for a UFO sightings table using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the D3.js and Bootstrap frameworks. The filter feature should allow users to filter the table data based on several criteria, such as date, city, and shape.

## Summary
A potential issue with the current design is that users may find it difficult to identify the appropriate parameter to use for filtering, such as selecting a specific city. They may need to scroll through the entire table to find the desired city for analysis. To address this, a solution could be to provide drop-down lists containing all available filter values in place of the current input fields. The drop-down lists should update automatically after a parameter is selected in any filter. Additionally, including a "Clear Filters" button located below the last filter would allow users to easily reset the table data and start a new search. These improvements could improve the usability and user experience of the filter feature.
